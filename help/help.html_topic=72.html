 <h2>Handing Off a Game to Another Player</h2>
If something happens to keep you from playing actively, and quitting would spoil the game for the other players, you can give a game position to another player. The "Handoff" link is located on your <a href="help.html_topic=26.html">Empire Page</a>.<P>
If a game is being played for <a href="help.html_topic=66.html">points</a>:<br>
<ul><li> The original player earns XP for the turns he played. The stand-in gets XP for the turns he plays.
<li> If the handoff takes place on or before turn 3, the original player gets no MP and the game does not affect his average. The stand-in gets MP and the game affects his average normally.
<li> If the handoff takes place on turn 4 or later, neither player gets MP and the game does not affect either one's average. (So yes, you could protect your average by giving a game away, at the cost of all the MP and XP you could have earned.)</ul>
