<h2><a href="2010-12-28.html">December 28, 2010:</a> SoFNN-Tiberius Outcomes And Rings Continue!</h2>
Ultracorps and SoFNN would like to extend congratulations to all commanders for participating in the recent Mega, and to highlight the top finishers overall, and by race.  For those who fought the brave fight but did not survive the mega, you also get congratulations for trying hard and not knuckling under, and remember: a new game will be coming soon for a chance at revenge or redemption, so keep checking for when you can enter!<br><br>

A special Team game PUB has opened for those who want to mix a little roleplay with their star battles!  Federation vs. The Borg is open for joining now- 3 Borg players (all to play sxullborg only) vs 3 Federation players (any race but sxullborg and arachnon).  Grab some teammates and play in coordinated fashion to defeat your enemies!  Note- only 3 per side, so if anyone joins as a 4th on one side, they will be booted.  Also note- the Borg have a little boost to make up for the deceased value of their perk in a shorter game.  It's a real challenge, so join up!<br><br>

Meanwhile, newer players can join "New Players", a PUB for 6 people with less than 150 xp- give it a try, then stop in chat to ask for help with game mechanics, strategy, and tactics! <br><br>

Overall winner: Agramer!  Congratulations on the "three-peat"!!<br><br>

Race Winners- Gold Badges (whether you need them badges, stinking or no):<br>
Arachnon- X'mexx (16 worlds)<br> 
CNM- Kilvan99 (25 worlds)<br> 
Ectonians- Replay (49 worlds)<br> 
Entradishar- Raven_walker (10 worlds)<br> 
Guir- Bozorg (6 worlds, and ONLY surviving Guir- well done!)<br> 
Mah-Tog- Sentrion (8 worlds)<br>
Nozama- Rearlsmith (31 worlds)<br> 
Orn- Agramer (77 worlds- Outstanding, and overall winner!)<br>
Swamp Beasts- Knightmare and Tower212 (Tie, at 10 worlds)<br> 
Sxullborgs- Breakers (45 worlds, and only surviving Sxull!)<br>
VaT'ak Warriors- Flat (47 worlds)<br>
Xirons- UC_Rommel (53 worlds)<br>
Zenrin- Devastar (21 worlds)<br><br>

We heartily encourage new players to try joining up for the next exciting mega game, coming in just a couple of weeks.  To play, you need to have completed at least one solo game, and you will likely have a much better idea of what to do if you try out a PUB (private universe battle) game or 2.  To that end, we will be opening up several games to play- look for them to join for those who wish to play/hone their games before the next mega opens for joining.  Also, keep an eye on the Rings as the end game approaches and big FP, exciting fights break out all over as commanders claw for the center of the ring (and the center of their opponents' thoraxes)!<br><br>
