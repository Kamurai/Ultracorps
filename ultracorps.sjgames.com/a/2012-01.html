<h2><a href="2012-01-30.html">January 30, 2012:</a> New Mega: Carrier Wars</h2>
<p>
The next mega game, Carrier Wars, is now open for joining. This is a classic-scored mega game with one significant unit change: the HC-4 space runway. This is now a speed 80 unit, to keep pace with its fighters.The license cost has also been increased to 1000, DF reduced to 97, AT reduced to 15, and carry reduced to 200.
</p>

<p>
No race starts with the HC-4, so you'll either have to buy or capture the license if you want to build them. (Remember the Mah-Tog can buy any license on turn 1!)  
</p>

<h2><a href="2012-01-17.html">January 17, 2012:</a> SOPA Blackout</h2>
<p>
On Wednesday, Jan. 18, the Steve Jackson Games site will be blacked out from 8am to 5pm CST as part of the worldwide SOPA/PIPA protest.
</p>

<p>
This blackout will NOT extend to <b><i>UltraCorps</i></b>, because I don't want to wreck anyone's position in their PUB games; some of you would not get your turns in if UC went down unexpectedly for 9 hours.
</p>

<p>
But please visit <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/">www.sjgames.com</a> to see what's happening. And remember that as a site with forums, <b><i>UltraCorps</i></b> COULD be taken down, arbitrarily and without warning, if SOPA/PIPA passes. Contact your representatives and tell them to oppose these bills!
<br>-- Steve Jackson

-  Commander Essex won a decisive battle against Commandress 5rdrake at Burden this past cycle, as Winter Ring 1 slogs on to turn 26!  At the same time, only 6 worlds separate the top 4 Commanders in Ring 1, so it's still anyone's Ring to win!  (Editor's note: Except Travail's.)          <br><br>
