<h2><a href="2006-06-22.html">June 22, 2006:</a> Kira Set Up Us The Bomb!</h2>
We have a new unit: the U-90 Biobomb. So called because it's Unit 90 in the database . . .<P>
This is the long-range population-killer that has been discussed a bit on the forums. It's available in all newly-started games. Give it a try and let us have your feedback on the forums.

<h2><a href="2006-06-08.html">June 8, 2006:</a> E-Mail Tick Notifications</h2>
<p>
You can now sign up to receive e-mail when your PUB game has ticked. Click on the "Empire" tab in your game to enter your e-mail address.
</p>
<p>
Right now you have to enter it on a per-game basis.
</p>
<p>
I don't have plans to make this work for Mega games, since that'd be a lot of mail, and Megas usually run on a fixed schedule anyway.<br>

<h2><a href="2006-06-06.html">June 6, 2006:</a> Glitch With Certain PUB Games</h2>
The following PUB games suffered a system glitch today:<br>
<ul>
<li>#11964 - 06-06-06 Afternoon Blitz Game
<li>#11859 - Four-Way War
<li>#11547 - Work-Week Special V
<li># 9200  -  Death to Ahabig
<li>#11888 - Texas Three-a-day
<li>#11376 - Empires In Space
<li>#11675 - GHC 4: Psych Out
</ul>

Possibly some others, though these were the ones I noticed stuck in the tick. I've unlocked the games, but the last tick did not run to completion - it died during the battles phase. Some battles may have run; others may not have. Scanners will NOT have updated.
<p>
Anyway, my advice is to proceed with the next tick, which should clear things out, but if you continue having problems with your game, please <a href="mailto:kira@sjgames.com">e-mail me.</a><br>

<h2><a href="2006-06-03.html">June 3, 2006:</a> Kilroy Has Ended!</h2>
<p>
Kilroy has ended! It ran for 37 turns. Congratulations to <a href="https://secure.sjgames.com/login/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fultracorps.sjgames.com%2Fzgame%2Fgame%2Fprofile.html%3FplayerID%3D29531">Black Star</a>, who finished with 73 worlds. (Hmm. 73:37... )  Also, despite the Xiron owning the top 10 early in the game, the final rankings were more evenly distributed: one Arachnon, 4 Mah-Tog, a Cosmic Needle Man, a Va'Tak, and two Xiron... plus a 3-way tie for 10th between two Xiron and a CNM.
</p>

<p>
While we didn't get point scoring going this game, we have made some improvements both to visible pages (profiles, zero-lock licenses, accurate prodq estimates) and to behind-the-scenes stuff. We also learned some things (this map was too spaced-out; expect your neighbors to be closer next time).
</p>

<p>
We don't have any ETA on when the next Mega game will start; til then, there are plenty of PUBs going on, including a PvP PUB Tourney. Check out the <a href="http://forums.sjgames.com/forumdisplay.php?f=50">forums</a> for details!
