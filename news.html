Breakers and Greyhulk are tied for the lead in March of Madness!  Malmbando is a close 3rd.  Three other players are tied for 4th.  With around a week to go, lots of things can happen.

Pandemic is slated to start on April Fool's Day, April 1st.  There are about three more days to join if anyone wants to sign up for strategy, diplomacy and battle - not necessarily in that order.<BR>

With a lot of the galaxy under lock-down it seems like a good time to run another Mega Game.  It will be a little like the wild west with an assymetrical map and wide spacing.  It should be different and fun.  Feel free to share the Ultracorps.com link around as many people will be looking for things to do as they stay close to home in this global pandemic.  The game will be available for joining in a little less than a week.<br>-- Starcharger, Fleet Admiral

The March of Madness is upon us! A grueling match of 31 turns, give or take one or two, will end with the victor taking the spoils.<BR><BR>
The game is open for joining now and will close on February 29th to new players. The map will be built and populated and commanders will have about two days to make their first move before the first tick on March 2nd at 8 PM Steve Jackson Games time.<BR><BR>
Another Mega will start in May, and in each odd numbered month, with a Holiday Ring Game in December.<BR><BR> <br>-- Starcharger, Fleet Admiral
