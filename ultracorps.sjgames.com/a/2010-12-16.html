<h2><a href="2010-12-16.html">December 16, 2010:</a> Sort Of Fabulous Network News- Special Palindromic Focus</h2>
Tiberius: Turn 28......Rings 1&2: Turn 13!<br><br>

Action Item: Not As Easy As 1-2-3!!<br><br>
- Demonstrating an infinita of resourcefulness, Commander Knight "and Day" Mare took the homeworld 1-2-3 of Commander CKBisk in a mutually ablative battle.  Kinghtmare reported to us: "Do-Re-Mi, A-B-C, 1-2-3... hey, it's you and me."  CKBisk replied, defiantly palindromic: "Satan oscillate my metallic sonatas!"<br><br>

Second Item: It's A Constant-inople Struggle!<br>
- Who can stop Commander "Instant" Replay?  (Editor's note: Seriously.  And he needs to be stopped if anyone else wants top Ectonian.  Grrr.)  He took Constantinople from Commander Shadow "of my former self" Bane when the world was literally crawling with crawlers.  (Editor's note: ATO-3's, that is, likely to assist evacuation of the civilian population.) Replay told this reporter in song: "An ATO-3 may be quite Constantinople, but bot4's are a boy's best friend."  Shadowbane replied in palindrome: "Dammit, I'm Mad." <br><br>

Third Item: Ring 1- Stock Values Of Palindromes Fall Sharply!<br>
- In the first HW capture of both wintry rings, the world of Bob was captured by an upstart commander with delusions of adequacy. The palindromic commander of Bob, Commander Bob, was understandably upset, as were his palindromic parents, mom and dad. In an exclusive (and extended) palindromic statement to SoFNN, Bob said about the defeat of his space program in this season: "A Santa lived as a devil at NASA."  When asked if he would clarify this statement, he palindromically replied: " Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward to new era?"  <br><br>

Fourth Item: Ring 2- No "Easter Egg" At Cadbury!<br>
- Commander Slim Hoss continued his advance this cycle, with a successful attack and capture of Cadbury.  Fortunately, no invisible HSF's were present on the planet, as that "Easter Egg" might otherwise have been truly "rotten".  A palindromic spokesman for the planet said, after the attack: "Get set, Ed, to not detest Egg-nog!"<br><br>

And now, a word from our sponsor: Disciples of the Path of Constipated Enlightenment- "The enema of good is perfection."<br><br>Travail, UC News Reporter
