 <h2>PUB Game Reputation</h2>

If you run PUB games, your players will get to rate your performance as a Game Master. Before you join a PUB game, you should look at the owner's reputation on his <a href="help4078.html?topic=25">Profile</a> page, to see what previous players thought of the way he manages his games.<P>

When you play a PUB game that lasts at least eight turns, you will get a rating form upon leaving the game, whether that is<ul>
<li> After the game ends, or
<li> After you quit, or
<li> After you are booted.</ul>

You can give either a positive or negative rating, or you can decline to give a rating. If you give a negative rating, you <b>must</b> include a comment. You don't have to give a comment on a positive rating, but you may.<P>

Ratings have no effect on a player's permanent rankings or his ability to run PUB games, but if you have a lot of negative ratings, other players may be slow to join your games.<P>

You can always see all the ratings you have given other players, and all the ratings they have given you, from your own <a href="help4078.html?topic=25">Profile</a> page.<P>

If you give someone a negative rating, you cannot join any more of his PUB games.<P>

If you give someone a negative rating, you can remove it at any time, starting from your own <a href="help4078.html?topic=25">Profile</a> page. If you remove the negative rating, you may once again join that player's PUBs. We suggest you not do this unless you are sure the person has mended his ways!<P>

If you play in another game run by the same person, your new rating will overwrite the old one. Thus, a negative can overwrite a positive or a "no rating." A positive can overwrite a "no rating." A positive cannot overwrite a negative, because you have to delete the negative before you can join the new game!<P><hr>
