<B>CA</B> - Carry. A unit stat. If CA is positive, the unit can travel in space and can carry this much "weight" of non-space-traveling units. If CA is negative, the unit cannot travel in space by itself and this negative CA is the unit's "weight." If CA is 0, the unit can travel in space but cannot carry other units. Details <a href="help.html_topic=12.html#CA">here</a>.<P>
<B>Capital unit</B> or <B>capital ship</B> - A general term for very powerful units which require a lot of CPX to build. They are in a separate category on the <B>license</B> purchase page.<P>

<B>Factory world</B> - A world with a high population and (probably) a variety of important licenses. <b>Feeder worlds</b> (below) send Ultranium there, and usually population too, allowing for efficient central production of large units.

<B>Fighter</B> - Any small combat unit that can travel between worlds on its own.<P>
<B>Fighter rolling</B> - A late-game tactic used especially in an uncontested area of Nobody or weakly defended worlds. Capture a world, produce nothing but fighters fast enough to reach the next world, repeat.<P>
<B>FP</B> - Firepower. A unit stat; also applies to fleets, worlds, and empires. Firepower is an <I>approximation</i> of battle effectiveness.

<B>Fodder</B> - From "cannon fodder." A general term for units whose main tactical role is to draw fire away from vulnerable units or <b>capital ships</b>. Without fodder, even the most powerful units may be lost to a lucky hit. With fodder, it takes a VERY lucky hit.<P>

<B>Hits</B> - An imaginary unit stat, useful in predicting battle results. Multiplying <B>OF</B> by <B>AT</B> gives the expected number of hits the unit will inflict in a combat round. If your hits exceeds the defender's <B>soak</B>, you can expect to wipe out most of the fleet in one round (though a few stragglers will usually survive). If it's half the <B>soak</B>, then you can expect to kill half the fleet, and so on.<P>
<B>License</B> - The factory, training center, or other production facility that lets you build a given type of unit. Details <a href="help.html_topic=39.html">here</a>.<P>
<B>Lock</B> - In games with an economy, orders for units can be "locked in" at the current price, and then you "have a lock" on that unit even if the price goes up.

<B>Soak</B> - An imaginary unit stat, useful in predicting battle results. A unit's soak is the number of hits it takes, on the average, to kill it. A unit with DF 50, for instance, has a 50% chance of being killed by each hit it takes, so its soak is 2. A unit with DF 99 takes, on the average, 100 hits to kill it, so its soak is 100. For fleets of moderate size and uniform composition, total soak is a pretty good indicator of how many shots it will take to kill most of the fleet. Big fleets, and fleets with some super-high-DF units, can be tougher.<P>
<B>SP</B> - Speed. A unit stat: the number of units each turn the unit can travel in space. (Yes, that sentence uses <b>unit</b> in two senses.) A unit with SP 0 cannot travel in space and must be carried. Details <a href="help.html_topic=12.html#SP">here</a>.<P>

The technique of leaving just enough Ult or Pop on a world so that production ends with a unit exactly finished.

As long as 1 Ult and 1 Pop are spent on an order, its price is locked in. On the next turn, you can let the order proceed if the price went up, or cancel it and re-place it if the price has gone down.<P>
