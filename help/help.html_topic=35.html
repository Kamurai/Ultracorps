 <h2>Show All Fleets</h2>
<p>To help you manage large empires, the <b>All Fleets</b> page lets you see all in-transit and stationed fleets at a glance. Stationed fleets are at a planet and have no orders. In-transit fleets are those currently traveling through space, getting closer to their destination each tick. You can see how far these fleets have to go by looking in the <b>Units Away</b> column. This also shows the distance newly deployed fleets have to travel before arriving at their destinations. Remember that you cannot give orders of any kind to a fleet once it's in transit.</p>
<h2>Checking Stationed Fleets</h2>
<p>Stationed fleets are shown at the top of the report. These are the fleets that are not yet deployed. They won't move unless given orders. Checking this list is a good way to make sure you haven't forgotten to give orders to some of your forces!</p>
<p>If you have any stationed fleets, this section will show up in red just to help you notice them.</p>
<p>For more information on how to assemble and deploy fleets, see <a href="help.html_topic=33.html">Fleets</a>.</p>
<h2>Checking Base Fleets</h2>
Every world has a base fleet, consisting of all the unassigned units there. Because this part of the report can get spammy, you won't see your base fleets unless you click the <b>Show Base Fleets</b> link at the bottom of the report.<p>
<h2>To Show All Fleets</h2>
There are two ways to get to the <b>All Fleets</b> table.
<ul>
<li>In the navigation bar at the top of any game page, click the "fleet" icon, which shows a spaceship.
<li>Or, on a <a href="help.html_topic=27.html">World Information</a> page, click the <b>Show All Fleets</b> button next to the Fleets section.</li></ul><p>
On the <b>All Fleets</b> table:<ul>
<li>Roll over a fleet's name to see its contents. (Clicking works too.)</li>
<li>Click any column head to sort by that column. For instance, if you click <b>ETA</b>, your fleets will be ordered by increasing ETA at their target. Or if you click <b>To</b>, fleets will be ordered alphabetically by their destination world, grouping all fleets together that are headed to the same place.</li>
<li>Click a world's name to access its <a href="help.html_topic=27.html">World Information</a> page.</li>
</ul>

Kira, we know the above screenshot is obsolete. When it changes, please change the fleetname and worldname in the paragraph below.
<--->
<h2><A NAME="show">To See Impending Battles</a></h2>
<p>A black box with double-red border indicates a world you don't own. When the fleet arrives there will be a battle (unless it's a gift fleet). In the screenshot above, the fleet "Intrepid Pirate" is headed for Agden, where there will be a battle.</p>
<h2><A NAME="show">To Deploy A Fleet</a></h2>
<p>You can deploy a stationed fleet from this screen by clicking the <b>Deploy</b> button. If a fleet has no <b>Deploy</b> button, it means it's too heavy to lift off, and the amount by which it's too heavy is shown instead.</p><hr>
