<h2><a href="2008-01-31.html">January 31, 2008:</a> Downtime Thursday Night / Friday Morning</h2>
Our service provider, Grande, has just told its users there will be six-hour downtime window, starting at midnight CST tonight (Thursday the 31st). We are to expect "intermittent service disruptions throughout the duration."

<h2><a href="2008-01-26.html">January 26, 2008:</a> How Fast Can You Solo?</h2>
<p>
The Festivus games have ended; thanks to everyone who played. We have rolled back the average points that were awarded for those games; see <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?p=523109#post522914">this thread</a> for details. All Festivus players will keep the Master Points (MP) they won.
</p>

<p>
Our next mega game will open soon. Meanwhile, why not try besting your solo game record? We have some nice shiny badges for anyone who completes a solo game in record time (badges are awarded for solos completed in 8 turns or less). You'll also win some XP (up to 20 XP for a solo in 5 turns.) We've also created a special badge for anyone that manages the impossible: a solo in 4 turns. Will you be the one?

<h2><a href="2008-01-16.html">January 16, 2008:</a> Combined Battle Reports</h2>
Battle reports are now displayed in combined view. This means that all of your units are shown in a single column, rather than one column per fleet. This should make it easier to view large battles. You can still view the old one-column-per-fleet display by clicking on the "View report by fleet" link.

<h2><a href="2008-01-13.html">January 13, 2008:</a> Avatars!</h2>
<p>
As of now, you can add an avatar to your profile . . . once you have reached 50 XP. Once we launch, only subscribers will be able to add avatars, but those who earn avatars during the beta will get to keep them.
</p>

<p>
To add an avatar, visit your <a href="https://secure.sjgames.com/login/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fultracorps.sjgames.com%2Fzgame%2Fgame%2Fprofile.html">profile</a> page.
</p>

<p>
We're also having an avatar contest. Send us your best <B><I>UltraCorps</I></B>-related avatars (in 100x100 GIF or JPG format). Winning images will go into our avatar library, which other players may choose from. Winners will receive 5 XP for each winning image.
</p>

<p>
Visit the <a href="https://secure.sjgames.com/login/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fultracorps.sjgames.com%2Fzgame%2Fgame%2Favatar.html">avatar</a> page for more info.

<h2><a href="2008-01-09.html">January 9, 2008:</a> Looking For A Perl Coder Or Two</h2>
We've thought for quite a while that we were very close to launch with <B><I>UltraCorps</I></B> . . . but there's still a significant to-do list, and not as much of Kira's time is available as when we started this. We would be happy to hear from competent Perl coders interested in part-time contracting to help us get to launch. And, obviously, somebody who is <I>playing</I> UC would have a much shorter learning curve, and would treat the project as more than just a job. So we're putting this announcement here rather than our more general news sites!<P>
I'm best reached at sj@sjgames.com. Include basic resume information, please.<BR>
