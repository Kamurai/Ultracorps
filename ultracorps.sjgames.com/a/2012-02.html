<h2><a href="2012-02-27.html">February 27, 2012:</a> SoFNN- Carrier Wars Update!!</h2>
Carrier Wars Mega, Turn 25!         <br><br>

Bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!!            <br><br>

Action Item:  No Horsing Around: Stakes At Belmont Are High!         <br>
-  Commander Orbit Tango rolled in a serious feint at Belmont this past cycle, one which landed the largest battle of the cycle due to the huge amount of stockpiled fp in the arsenal of Commander Kevlarik.  The lone cargo booster was captured by defenders after the planet-wide alert was sounded.  "It was like a Tango in Orbit" reported one anonymous source in Belmont command.       <br><br>

Second item: Gossamer-Like Defenses More Than They Seem at xXx!!    <br><br>
-  Warlord Sentrion invaded xXx this past cycle with a strong force, anchored by a pair of bot4's, but was repelled by the defending armada of General Gossimer.  The bazillion x fighters stationed at the defense of the beleaguered HW were bolstered by the HC4's in the exact way that too few able defenses have utilized the HC4's to date.  It recalls the effective and canny defense of Salvage Yard about 5 turns ago, against an upstart commander with delusions of adequacy, and illustrates the effectiveness of these carriers at war... When supported properly.       <br><br>

Third Item: Andy Mangles Lord's Prayer And Paternoster!    <br><br>
-  Commandy Andy6474 rolled a large force into Paternoster this past cycle, in a bid for dominion of the planet.  Regarding the world, Andy remarked to reporters; "Well, Paternoster, or Our Father in common, whose art's uneven, horrid be thine aim."       <br><br>


And now, a word from our sponsor:  Happy Go Lucky Piñata Service Corp.- "More fun than you can shake a stick at!"          <br><br>Travail, UC News Reporter

<h2><a href="2012-02-22.html">February 22, 2012:</a> SoFNN- Carrier Wars Continues!!</h2>
Carrier Wars Mega, Turn 20!         <br><br>

Bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!!            <br><br>

Action Item: Sentrion Auditions As Budding "Pron" Star!             <br>
- A big and decisive battle took place this past cycle, resulting in the capture of pron by Sentrion from the Ornery HCobb. In a statement to SoFNN, Sentrion told us: "Well, first I counted up soak and strike, then I divided by 5, carried the 4, and, well you know, it just worked out well."       <br><br>

Second item:  P_Showin'off Asks "Okay, Now Where's Otis"?   <br><br>
-  P_schoenhoff captured the HW of Milo from Brendanjlane this past cycle, using a moderate sized nozball with extreme ESF overflight. What's next on the horizon?  "Hive and seek!"      <br><br>

Third Item: Bull Halsey Answers "What Are You Called In The Bathroom"!    <br><br>
- Well, he did when he took Paneuropa this past cycle, in a brutal battle with Helgrenze.  We caught up with him to catch his statement: "A Paneuropean!"            <br><br>


And now, a word from our sponsor: Animal Farm Petting Zoo- "Where some children are more equal than others".   <br><br>Travail, UC News Reporter

<h2><a href="2012-02-12.html">February 12, 2012:</a> SoFNN- Carrier Wars Underway!</h2>
Carrier Wars Mega, Turn 10!     <br><br>

Bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention! Also, for anyone wondering how cool it would be to play a ring game with 9 other players, in which the only unit change is the scan-o-matic (which can now carry 10 zenrin master, 10 scuttlers, 1 boron buggie, 2 all terrain vehicles, 10 ultranium, or any of the 10-equivalent hopes and dreams of would-be conquerors), you can now join "Ring Around The Base10 Clock" which opened for your enjoyment!            <br><br>

Action Item: "Go Now", Went...To Vivitech!             <br>
- VivitechEngineer (of Doom) went on the warpath, capturing Commander Leftradio's HW, Go Now this past cycle.  One might call it a hollow victory, since most of the population and ultranium also followed the planet's advice, and went before the invader arrived.  As the 5th HW to fall in Carrier Wars, Leftradio had this to say to the conqueror: "Go Now? Go fish!"       <br><br>

Second Item: Jpmurga Emerges Victorious, says "Shayzam!!"    <br><br>
- SwampBeastie Boy Jpmurga rolled into Shayzam this past cycle, emerging with an easy victory against the indigenous population. The pleased commander told us in an exclusive statement: "Next, it's on to Dyn-o-mite!"           <br><br>

Third Item: Scuttlebutt And Rumor Follow Sentrion!    <br><br>
- Well, they did until he successfully invaded Innuendo, seizing the planet in a closer-than-hoped for win.  We caught up with him in time to hear him tell his battle leaders: "Well, better Innuendo than out-you-end-o."              <br><br>


And now, a word from our sponsor: HC-4 Bus Lines- "We can be an integral part of any major system's less-than-rapid transit system!" <br><br>Travail, UC News Reporter
