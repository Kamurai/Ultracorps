<h2><a href="2011-01-19.html">January 19, 2011:</a> SoFNN- Valerian Mega News Update</h2>
Valerian: Turn 2!<br><br>

We're back and more fatigued than ever, but not too tired to begin the cycle of fun and excitement (Editor's note: work and more work) of reporting the news (Editor's note: And misreporting, distorting, and other various -orting's of the news) of Valerian Mega here on the Sort of Fantastic Network News.  For our loyal readers, we have a bunch of new wacky sponsors lined up (Editor's note: They've been practically breaking down our doors.  Not to sponsor- I just think they don't like us).  For our new readers, remember our eyes can't be everywhere (Editor's note: Or can they? Muhaha. Muahahahah! Oh, um, right), so if there's an interesting fight at an amusingly named planet, please feel free to mail that in to cub-reporter Travail.  (Editor's note: It may not get used, but if a pun can be made of it, it probably will.  For better or worse.)<br><br>

Action Item: Mutagens Are Hazardous To DNA And Zenrin!<br><br>
- Commander Expinger led the field in long battles at Mutagen this past cycle, with a 26 round fight resulting in a win at the planet.  In so doing, he has answered the age-old riddle: "How do you make a zenrin slurry?", losing 66 monks in the fight.  Asked about the fearsome toll, he told this reporter in a borrowed phrase: "Crunch all you want, we'll make more". <br><br>

Second Item: Down The Rabbit Hole!<br>
- General Rab_1 lost a close battle at Evangelion this past cycle, more notable for both the length of the combat as well as the painful loss of a starting psi hauler.  The defending force of the planet was reduced to a single unit, which even now celebrates with a refreshing TK "Tank Array" and tonic.  Asked about the loss of the hauler, Rab_1 merely psi-ed heavily in reply.<br><br>

Third Item: Migration Cancelled- Ducks Grounded!<br>
- Admiral "Peeking" Ducks heard the bad news as his fleets were unanticipatedly grounded during a battle at Mad Dog this past cycle when the normally-sturdy ATO-3 was shot out from under its payload of rovers and org2 by a talented sharpshooter.  Unfortunately for the defenders, they were swiftly reduced to slag along with a number of civilians under fire from the Admiral's OSAA2's as his forces took Mad Dog.  Plenty of scuttlers were had by all, but getting them off planet may be a bit of a chore.  An investigation into the firm which had produced the ATO-3 has been launched by Admiral Ducks. (Editor's note: And by investigation, we mean a bloody purge.)<br><br>

And now, a word from our sponsor: Masochists With Sprue- "We are glutens for punishment!"<br><br>Travail, UC News Reporter
