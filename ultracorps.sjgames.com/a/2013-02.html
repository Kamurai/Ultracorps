<h2><a href="2013-02-24.html">February 24, 2013:</a> SoFNN:  Triple Play, Maybe Half Way!- Turn 16</h2>
News, news, news, from the Sort of Fantastic Network News!!     <br><br>

With all the news that's fit to embellish, we are bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!    <br><br>

Triple Play Action Item: Wadd's Up With That?!!    <br><br>
- Commander Wadd won a squeaker at Homesworld this past cycle, against the marauding forces of Raven_Walker_Don't_Runner in the biggest FP-destroyed battle of the cycle.  Two CRorgs made the difference between win or lose for the defender, after a grueling battle between the two commanders.  In an unconfirmed statement, Wadd is said to have ordered underlings to "break out the bug juice" in order to celebrate.  <br><br>

Triple Play Second Item: Xenofruit Defense At Guiness: Stout!!    <br><br>
- Commander Xenofruit successfully defended Guiness, the former HW of Commander "I'm not so Zenful at the moment" Zen, after an attempt by the prior owner to wrest back control. Rumors on the ground among the occupation forces suggest an intense search for both insurgents and kegs of the former homeworld's homebrew. Sales of the new book "Zen and the Art of TKBike Racing" seem to have fallen with the news.     <br><br>

Triple Play Third Item: Kira And Shadowbane_X Tilt At Windmills!!    <br><br>
- Or at least that's what it looked like from orbit, as the attack fleets of both renowned commanders arrived at the same time to subjugate the planet Quixote. We caught up with Commander Kira to ask about the 3 way battle which resulted in the loss of a sizable fleet of hurax fighters.  In an exclusive statement to SoFNN, Kira quoted the planet's most famous past president, for whom it was named, with a venomous glance at Shadowbane_X: "Every man is as Heaven made him, and sometimes a great deal worse."        <br><br>

<h2><a href="2013-02-17.html">February 17, 2013:</a> Triple Play- Turn 9!</h2>
News, news, news!!     <br><br>

Though our staff have been lazy and lackadaisical, here we are again, bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!    <br><br>

Triple Play Action Item: DJPatch Finds Feast At Famine!!    <br><br>
-  Famine has been a busy place over the past 3 cycles, when it was first captured by DJPatch "Adams".  After the initial conquest, he's successfully defended it on sequential cycles from commanders Mongrell and Gimak.  Team Green promises that Death, Pestilence, and more War are on the way.  <br><br>

Triple Play Second Item: "If You're Going To Compete, Compete With Fervor!!"    <br><br>
-  Sun_Tzu and UltimateQuestion got into a dustup at Fervor this past cycle, where they slogged it out for 16 combat cycles over the burned corpses of civilian population when the fight moved from orbit to ground.  Sun-Tzu wrested control from UQ, and in a statement to SoFNN, he said: "Fervor?  I barely even knew her!"    <br><br>

Triple Play Third Item: Ba Xian The Happening Place- It Hosts A 3-Way!! <br><br>
-  A pair of invaders made plans to invade Ba Xian this past cycle, and unbeknownst to each other they arrived at the same instant.  Commanders Solitar and ShadowBane_X ended up fighting each other as well as the planetary defenses, in an all out battle royale.  In the end, the nozama hordes of Solitar, organized by their Queen, won the day against the zenrin horde.  The local populace immediately made the Queen at home, offering to name one of their capital's streets "The Noz Queen's Mews".  Her reply was to the effect that, while she was happy to be honored as a street, she was not a Mews'ed.     <br><br>

<h2><a href="2013-02-11.html">February 11, 2013:</a> Triple Play Underway!  Turn 3!</h2>
News, news, news!!     <br><br>

Though our staff have been lazy and lackadaisical, here we are again, bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!    <br><br>

Triple Play Action Item: Bianchi Finds Pleasant Un!!    <br><br>
-  Commander Bianchi launched an all out assault on Pleasant this past cycle, only to find out it wasn't all it was cracked up to be.  In the process, much of the 3 attacking fleets also were cracked up by the defenses of the planet.  To be sure, Bianchi won the engagement and secured the planet, but the primary surviving units do not look to be going anywhere for a while.  <br><br>

Triple Play Second Item: Blind Eye Turned to Dr. Sci!!    <br><br>
-  Dr. Sci sent his Noz hordes into Blind Eye this past cycle, in a mission which exploited the defense's blind spots.  (Which were all.)  In a statement to SoFNN, Dr. Sci stated: "We'll probably want to get some ointment on the whole planet for that."    <br><br>

Triple Play Third Item: UltimateQuestion No Stranger To Anguish!!   <br><br>
-  At least he isn't now, having subjugated the planet by extinguishing its population in the white hot flames of his 4 Incinerators.  The new denizens of the planet do not appear to be anguished in the least, but one wonders what will happen when the scuttlers have eaten all the carbonized native life?  <br><br>


And now, a word from our sponsor: Lilliput Interior Design Corp.- "We're basically minimalists, so deal with it." <br>Travail, UC News Reporter

<h2><a href="2013-02-01.html">February 1, 2013:</a> New Team Mega Open Now!</h2>
<p>
A new team mega "Triple Play" is now open for joining. You'll need to complete a solo game in order to join!
</p>

<p>
This is a 3-team game; the team with the most worlds wins. We'll also be trying out some new team game code here. It won't affect battles at all - if you attack a teammate you'll still destroy their stuff. But you'll be able to see team rankings in com-net.
</p>

<p>
Check out the <a href="https://secure.sjgames.com/login/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fultracorps.sjgames.com%2Fzgame%2Fgame%2Fgameinfo.html%3FgameID%3D75059">game info</a> page for more info, or to join.
