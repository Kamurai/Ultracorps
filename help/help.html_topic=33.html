 <h2>Fleets</h2>
<p>Every unit in the game is assigned to a fleet. You will create fleets to launch attacks on other worlds, to trade with allies, and to automatically gather and drop off cargo between worlds you own. The <B>Fleets</b> section of your World Information pages lists all fleets at that world, and lets you deploy, disband, or modify them, as well as making new ones. Click <a href="help.html_topic=27.html"><b>Command Cntr</b></a> on the navigation bar; then click a world on the <a href="help.html_topic=28.html">Star Map</a> to display its Information page. The Fleets section is directly under the world's image.</p>
Each fleet has a <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://ultracorps.sjgames.com/help/help.html?topic=50  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://ultracorps.sjgames.com/help/help.html?topic=50'">Firepower</a> number which gives an indication of its strength.
<h2><A NAME="base">Base Fleets</h2></a>
<p>Every world has a base fleet which contains all units not otherwise assigned (usually population, Ultranium, newly built units, and units which you are keeping there for defense). When you <i>assemble</i> a new fleet, units are taken from the base fleet and transferred to the new fleet. When you <i>disband</i> an assembled fleet, its units are dissolved into the base fleet. The Base Fleet is the LAST fleet listed on the page.</p>
<h2>Other Fleets</h2>
<p>Other fleets can be one of three types: Combat, Gift, or Auto. They appear in the Fleets section when they have just been assembled and are not yet in transit, or if they have just arrived. Each fleet has a name assigned by its owner (or, if the owner wishes, a randomly generated name).</p>
<h2><A NAME="create">To Create A Fleet</A></h2>
<ol>
    <li>At the bottom of the Fleets section, click the <b>Make New Fleet</b> button to display the Fleet Assembly page. This shows all units on the world and lets you move them back and forth between the world and the new fleet.</li>
    
    <li>Choose the fleet type: Combat (the default), Gift, or Auto. For more information, see <a href="help.html_topic=34.html">Auto Fleets and Gift Fleets</a>.</li>
    
    <li><form>To transfer units from the base fleet into the new fleet, click the <input type="button" value=" < "> arrow or enter numbers in the fields. If you use the <input type="button" value=" |< "> button, you will transfer ALL units of that type. (Exception: if the units being transferred are ground units, with a negative CA value, you'll transfer only as many as that fleet can currently hold.)</li>
    
    <li>For more information on a particular unit, click its name to display detailed <a href="unit.html">unit information</a>.</form></li>
    
    <li>As you transfer units in and out of your fleet, the total Carrying Capacity (<a href="help.html_topic=12.html#CA">CA</a>) of the fleet displays in the <b>Carry</b> field. If this number is negative, the fleet is too heavy and will not lift off. You can either add transports, like <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://ultracorps.sjgames.com/help/unit.html?id=36  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://ultracorps.sjgames.com/help/unit.html?id=36'">Cargo Boosters</a>, or remove units that have to be carried (indicated by negative CA ratings). <i>Note: You may still assemble a fleet, even though its CA is negative, and there may be times when you will choose to do so, but such a fleet cannot be deployed.</i></li>
    
    <li>Keep in mind that the overall Speed (<a href="help.html_topic=12.html#SP">SP</a>) of your fleet is determined by its slowest unit.
    
    <p><i>Experiment with moving units back and forth between world and fleet. Note that you can put population and Ultranium on a fleet, too. As the game progresses, it can become important to move these resources between worlds . . . but your initial combat fleets won't need them. Keep your people at home and put them to work.</i></p></li>
    
    <li>When your fleet is configured, enter a name in the <b>Name</b> field (or leave it blank to get a random name) and click <b>Assemble Fleet.</b> Click <b>Cancel Assembly</b> to exit without assembling the fleet.</li>
</ol>
<h2>To Deploy Fleets</h2>
<ol>
    <li>After you've assembled a fleet, click the <img src="/zgame/game/img/fleets/deploy.gif" alt="Deploy"> button next to the fleet's name on the World Information page.</li>
    <li>The fleet name will appear on the <a href="help.html_topic=28.html">Star Map</a>. Above the Star Map, you will see a panel with the fleet's name, speed, and Firepower. If this isn't the fleet you wanted to deploy, click the red <b>Cancel</b>. Otherwise, look for a target world on the <a href="help.html_topic=28.html">Star Map</a>. You can zoom in or out, or move the map view, without interfering with your deployment, and you can still mouse over worlds to get the "quick scan" information.
    <li>Click the world that you want to send your fleet to. Remember, if it's not your world, your fleet will attack.</li>
    
    <li>If you decide not to deploy the fleet after all, click the <b>Cancel</b> button in the panel above the Star Map, or just click the fleet's world of origin.
    
    <p><i>Note: When the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://ultracorps.sjgames.com/help/help.html?topic=7  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://ultracorps.sjgames.com/help/help.html?topic=7'">tick</a> runs, the fleet will travel toward the destination world at its maximum speed. When it arrives at a world you do not own, a <a href="help.html_topic=11.html">battle</a> will be fought. The winner will own the world. You'll learn the outcome when you log on during the next turn.</i></p></li>
</ol>
<h2><A NAME="modify">To Modify Fleets</a></h2>
<ol>
    <li>Click the <img src="/zgame/game/img/fleets/modify.gif" alt="Modify"> button next to the fleet's name to access the Fleet page. <i>Note: You can also modify <b>deployed</b> fleets, as long as they're still located on your world and not yet in transit.</i></li>
    
    <li><form>To transfer units to or from the fleet, click the arrows or enter numbers in the fields, just as if you were creating a new fleet.</form></li>
    
    <li>You can also change the fleet's name or its type.
    
    <li>Click <b>Assemble Fleet</b> to accept the modifications or <b>Cancel</b> to ignore them.</li>
</ol>
<h2><A NAME="disband">To Disband Fleets</a></h2>
<ol>
    <li>Click the <img src="/zgame/game/img/fleets/disband.gif" alt="Disband"> button next to a fleet to disband it and transfer all its units into the world's base fleet.</li>
</ol>
<h2><A NAME="transitmod">Modifying Fleets In Transit</a></h2>
<p>You can't do this. Once a fleet is in transit, you cannot add or remove units, divide the fleet, change the type of fleet, or change its speed or destination! You may only issue orders to a fleet while it is on a planet. In space, it's out of communication.</p><hr>
