 <h2>Player News</h2>
<p>Your Player News page is the first page you see upon entering an <b><i>UltraCorps</i></b> game. This page is only available to you. It contains links to headline articles, player rankings, in-game mail, battle news, and your worlds.</p>
<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://ultracorps.sjgames.com/help/screenshots/comnet.png  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://ultracorps.sjgames.com/help/screenshots/comnet.png'" target="_blank"><img src="/help/screenshots/comnet-t.png" vspace=5 hspace=10 alt="Player News" border="2" ></a>
<p>To access your Player News page from anywhere within <b><i>UltraCorps</i></b>, click the <b>COM-NET</b> button at the top of the screen.</p>
<h2>Game Information</h2>
This section tells you the turn number and next scheduled tick. It also links to the detailed <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://ultracorps.sjgames.com/help/help.html?topic=52  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://ultracorps.sjgames.com/help/help.html?topic=52'">Game Information</a> page and to <a href="help.html_topic=17.html">Player Rankings</a>. 
<h2>Headlines</h2>
<p>Headlines display below Game Information. They are in-game news . . . be sure to read the new headlines every turn! To display any headline topic, just click it.</p>
<h2>UltraMail</h2>
<p>Any new <a href="help.html_topic=21.html">UltraMail</a> (the in-game email sent by other players) appears here. By clicking a message, you can read and reply to it. Or you can click on the sender's name to get information about him.</p>
<h2>Forums</h2>
<p>Each game has its own in-game <a href="help.html_topic=22.html">forum</a>, exclusively for that game's players. The <B>Forum</b> link will take you straight to the forum for the game you are in. There is also a <B>Forums</b> button in the ComNet sidebar, which will take you to the general forums area.</p
<h2>Recent Battles</h2>
<p>Battle News appears at the top right. It shows all your combats on the last tick. "Captured From" and "Defended From" results are good news - you won the battle. These are indicated by green arrows. "Captured By" means somebody took one of your worlds. "Defended By" means your attack on that world was a failure. (You won't have to punish the commander; a fleet which loses is wiped out to the last being.) Lost battles are indicated by red arrows.</p>
<p>Click <a href="help.html_topic=23.html">Review Battle</a> to check out the round-by-round action, or click a world name to view its <a href="help.html_topic=27.html">
World Information</a> page.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the battle listing is a link that will let you <B>List All Battles</b> you have had in the entire game.</p>
<h2>Worlds</h2>
<p>Below the battle news is a listing of every world in your empire. Asterisks (*) indicate worlds that you conquered on the previous tick. Clicking a world name takes you to its <a href="help.html_topic=27.html">World Information</a> page and shows its position on the <a href="help.html_topic=28.html">Star Map</a>.</p><hr>
