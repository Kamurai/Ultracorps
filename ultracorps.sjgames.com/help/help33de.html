 <h2>Unit Production</h2>

<p>In the quest for galactic domination, you need more, bigger, and better forces. The Production section on each <a href="help3df3.html?topic=27">World Information</a> page lets you order new units on that world, and shows the status of all existing orders. To review the introduction to the production system, see <a href="help8fd9.html?topic=8">Production</a>.</p>

<h2><A NAME="place">To Place Production Orders</A></h2>
<ol>
    <li>On a World Information page, click <b>New Order</b> to display the Production page. This page shows the list of units that can be built on that world. See <a href="help7930.html?topic=39">Licenses</a> to learn how to add other units to this list.</li>
    
    <li>Click the radio button next to the unit you want to produce.</li>
    
    <li>Enter an amount in the <b>Quantity</b> field. The amount may not exceed the number in the unit's <a href="helpa644.html?topic=10#Max">Max</a> column. If you want to buy the maximum number, click the <b>Buy Max</b> button, and the quantity will automatically be set to the maximum. If you need more units than that, you must place more orders . . . you can place multiple orders for the same unit, or click the <img src="../../secure.sjgames.com/login/indexafa1.html" align="texttop"> button to duplicate an existing order.</li>
    
    <li>Click <b>Buy</b> to place the order. You should see an acknowledgement at the top of the screen.</li>
    
    <li>Repeat the process if you want to place another order.</li>
    
    <li>When you're finished, click <b>Finished</b> to return to the World Information page.</li>

</ol>

<h2>To Review Production Orders</h2>
Go to one of your World Information pages and scroll down to the Production section. This lists the world's "queue" of production orders. Each order is in one of three states: Finished, In Progress, or Waiting.

<p><img src="screenshots/world-production.png" vspace=5 hspace=10 alt="Production Queue"></p>
<i>A world's Production Queue, showing both what was built last tick and what is in the queue now.</i></p>
    
    <ul type=disc>
        <li><h3>Finished Orders</h3>
        When a production order has been completed, the status column reads <i><b>Finished</b></i>. It is followed by the number of units completed during the previous tick. The <i><b>Status</b></i> column indicates the total number of units produced in the order. You will only see orders finished during the previous tick.</li>
    
        <li><h3>In Progress Orders</h3>
        At any time, only <i>one</i> production order on a world can be in progress. Work on the next order begins only after the previous order is finished or canceled. The cost per unit for an in-progress order is fixed and does not fluctuate with the <a href="helpd0d3.html?topic=9">economy</a>. The progress of the current order can be seen in the <b>Status</b> column:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Produced:</b> Total units produced so far. When this number equals the <i><b>Qty</b></i> column, the order is finished.</li>
    
            <li><b>Last Turn:</b> Number of units produced during the last tick and added to the <a href="help810a.html?topic=33#base">Base Fleet</a>.</li>
    
            <li><b>Unit <i>X:</i></b> Percentage of completion of the unit in progress. When a unit is not completely built, this number indicates how far along it is. If a unit is half built, for instance, it will require half the rated CST in Ultranium, and half the unit's CPX in population, to get it finished.</li>
        </ul></li>
    
        <li><h3>Waiting Orders</h3>
        When you place a new order, or when a world has not yet begun production on an existing order, its status is <b>Waiting</b>. These orders remain in the world's production queue. They will be completed in the order they appear.</li>
    </ul>

 <h3>To Rearrange the Production Queue</h3>   
<p>Click <img src="../../secure.sjgames.com/login/index80bc.html" align="texttop"> to move an order to the top of the production queue. (But you cannot move a unit order above the order for its license!)</p>
    
<h3>To Cancel an Order, and to Restore It Again</h3>   
<p>Click <img src="../../secure.sjgames.com/login/index67e8.html" align="texttop"> to cancel the order. <i>Note: If you cancel a partially completed unit, it will be lost entirely, and you will not get back the Ultranium already spent on it.</i></p>
<P>However, you CAN change your mind after canceling, as long as the tick hasn't run.</p>
<p>After you cancel an order, you'll notice a new icon <img src="../../secure.sjgames.com/login/indexba7a.html" align="texttop"> in the "Orders" column of the production queue. Click the icon to restore the cancelled order to your queue. 

<h3>To Duplicate a Production Order</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to duplicate an existing production order. The most common reason is to produce a lot of small units. As part of the economic system, you are limited to ordering 50 units at a time, even with the smallest units, and the largest units can only be ordered one at a time.</p>
<p>But, especially in a game with no economy, you may want to get around that. To do so, use the "Clone Order" button, which looks like this: <img src="../../secure.sjgames.com/login/indexafa1.html" align="texttop">. Click this button beside any order to place a complete duplicate of that order.</p>

<h3>To Clear the Production Queue</h3>
<p>The <b>Empty Q</b> button will remove all items in the production queue, <i>including any partially built one</i>. It's a time-saver when you decide to totally reorganize a world's production.</p>

<h2>To Review All Worlds' Production</h3>
<p>Click the "factory" icon in the top bar to see the <b>All Production</b> page. This shows all your worlds and their current production orders. If there are worlds with no production, they will be noted at the top of the report.</p>

<h2>Autobuilding</h2>
<p>Under certain circumstances, your homeworld will build without orders, or Nobody worlds will build new units. This is called "autobuilding," and it gets its own topic <<a href="help7e00.html?topic=85">here</a>.</p><hr>
