<h2><a href="2012-04-24.html">April 24, 2012:</a> SoFNN- Brief Update: Eye Spy Mega!</h2>
Eye Spy, turn 32!     <br><br>

Bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!  Despite many expectations and more than a few hopes, Eye Spy something with my I that begins with A..... Another Tick!  At least we can now expect only one more tick, which supports the famous quote: "On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero."       <br><br>

Action Item: Zpo Beaten By "Ardent Spatula"!     <br>
- "Gentleman Gim" Gimak added a few brushstrokes to Paint this past cycle, destroying "A to Z"po's garrisoning fleets in the takeover.  Gimak told us: "The damage to the planet is all superficial- we'll just throw another coat of itself on it and it will look fine."  In a contrasting statement, Zpo said: "Yeah, well, Gimak just Painted himself into a coroner!"
  <br><br>

Second Item: Lucky Jump Seems To Have Been!  <br><br>
- Commander Habig "This Big!" took a jump at Lucky Jump, and was rewarded with a moderately unlikely victory, one which the "Wherefore Art Thou" Romeo battlecomputer predicted at approximately 37%.  I guess it's not true: White Zen CAN jump!       <br><br>

Third Item: Xeno Phobia Manifests Strongly!    <br><br>
- A four-way fight at Xeno took place this past cycle, as 3 different commanders all attempted to wrest the planet from "He's a" Maniac.  The planet went to Left "No Soap" Radio, after his large, mixed force used their 67 scan-o-matic pogo sticks to enter the fray. Seems to be a good thing he hadn't Left it for the final tick!       <br><br>


And now, a word from our sponsor: Beauty Pageant News Services- "Although she thought she'd won, Miss Perception was only runner-up!" <br><br>Travail, UC News Reporter

<h2><a href="2012-04-18.html">April 18, 2012:</a> SoFNN- Brief Update: Eye Spy Mega!</h2>
Eye Spy, turn 25!     <br><br>

Bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention, but with long breaks in between due to fatigue and busy-ness! We now return you to your irregularly scheduled broadcasts.        <br><br>

Action Item: D.H. Lawrence Turns Over In Grave!     <br>
- The well-known, deceased old Terran poet (1885-1930, Old Terran Calendar) would have suffered tragically had he been alive today, as Elysium was broken this past cycle.  Yes, fabled HW of Zpo (Editor's note: Zero Potential Omniscience?) was cracked by the inexorable (Editor's note: And very slow-moving) fleets of Commander "Edgar Allen Poe Hates Me" Kilraven.  The mix of HC4's, x-fighters, and RCW's defeated a much higher fp force stationed at Zpo's now-former HW.  Rousted out of his own cluster, Kilraven's rag-tag, fugitive fleet found a shining beacon in space, and then beat up everyone there to seize control. In a statement to reporters, Zpo spoke the timeless words of a famous D.H. Lawrence poem, "Elysium":  <BR><BR>Delivered helpless and amazed <BR> From the womb of the All, <BR>I am waiting, dazed <BR>For memory to be erased. <BR>Then I shall know the Elysium <BR>That lies outside the monstrous womb <BR>Of time from out of which I come. 

  <br><br>

Second Item: When Moon Is Least Common Denominator, 'Bat Falls To 'Gun!  <br><br>
- Commander "Zombie Dice" Kira led a successful attack against the besieged and beleagured homeworld of Commander "Irony Is Not An Element On The Periodic Table" HCobb this past cycle, capturing Moonbat with a fleet based around a core of Moonguns.  The novel fleet composition served definitive notice against Hcobb, a mere two cycles after his successful and spirited defense against Commander "I Make Maps And Put Them Down" Thrognor.  Asked where she got the idea for tucking a bunch of Moonguns into the core of a fleet, she simply replied: "I don't know, but I think my friend Darth said something about it last week...."       <br><br>

Third Item: "No Mr. Bond, I Expected You To Die! Again!"    <br><br>
-  Or so the planet Blofeld and its owner Commander "*" Asteriscus thought this past cycle, attacked as it was by Commander "AJ" Admljoey, but the VaT'ak marauder was able to pull off a convincing victory.  Of course, on the down side, the loss of several "E class" Haulers in the fight means there are now a bunch of battlestations with 4 flat tires sitting on landing strips with cardboard '4 Sale' signs on them. In an offhand comment to the press, Asteriscus said: "Blofeld never saw the Specter of defeat in time. Again."      <br><br>


And now, a word from our sponsor: Limericks For Overweight Punsters, Inc: <BR><BR> "My body's a bit 'out of place',<BR>and I can't get my corset up-laced!<BR>My two 'kissing' thighs<BR>have near-doubled in size-<BR>Why? 'Cause I only run when I'm chaste!"<BR>
