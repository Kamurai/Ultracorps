<h2><a href="2012-04-24.html">April 24, 2012:</a> SoFNN- Brief Update: Eye Spy Mega!</h2>
Eye Spy, turn 32!     <br><br>

Bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!  Despite many expectations and more than a few hopes, Eye Spy something with my I that begins with A..... Another Tick!  At least we can now expect only one more tick, which supports the famous quote: "On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero."       <br><br>

Action Item: Zpo Beaten By "Ardent Spatula"!     <br>
- "Gentleman Gim" Gimak added a few brushstrokes to Paint this past cycle, destroying "A to Z"po's garrisoning fleets in the takeover.  Gimak told us: "The damage to the planet is all superficial- we'll just throw another coat of itself on it and it will look fine."  In a contrasting statement, Zpo said: "Yeah, well, Gimak just Painted himself into a coroner!"
  <br><br>

Second Item: Lucky Jump Seems To Have Been!  <br><br>
- Commander Habig "This Big!" took a jump at Lucky Jump, and was rewarded with a moderately unlikely victory, one which the "Wherefore Art Thou" Romeo battlecomputer predicted at approximately 37%.  I guess it's not true: White Zen CAN jump!       <br><br>

Third Item: Xeno Phobia Manifests Strongly!    <br><br>
- A four-way fight at Xeno took place this past cycle, as 3 different commanders all attempted to wrest the planet from "He's a" Maniac.  The planet went to Left "No Soap" Radio, after his large, mixed force used their 67 scan-o-matic pogo sticks to enter the fray. Seems to be a good thing he hadn't Left it for the final tick!       <br><br>


And now, a word from our sponsor: Beauty Pageant News Services- "Although she thought she'd won, Miss Perception was only runner-up!" <br><br>Travail, UC News Reporter
