<h2><a href="2013-05-15.html">May 15, 2013:</a> SoFNN- Mega News Update- Elemental War, Turn 25!</h2>
News, news, news, from the Sort of Fantastic Network News!!     <br><br>

With all the news that's fit to embellish, we are bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!   <br><br>

Elemental War Action Item: Ramius Makes It Through Red "May"!!    <br><br>
- A humongous battle was waged at Ramius this past cycle, with Commander "Robinson" Caruso's forces carrying the day in victory after a brutal campaign by invader, Commander "What the?" Helldar.  Folks, everything was in this battle, including a submarine!  (Editor's note: Well, not really.  But 'hyperbole' is not part of any convention of war, so we went with it.)   <br><br>

Elemental War Second Item: Why Not To Spill Coffee In Your Lap!!    <br><br>
- General Platton was burned at work this past cycle, trying to defend his (now former) HW of BurnedAtWork.  The successful invader was Commander "I Think That I Shall Never See A Poem Lovely As A" Trebor, who was aided by the sudden appearance of the TK Tour de France, which showed up with 25 TK bike riders looking for a finish line.  In the skirmish, one of the riders was killed, but race officials were quoted as saying: "Yes, it's true, and although he wasn't blood doping, he was a dope, so it's okay."  All kudos to General Platton, who had had to fend off an attack at the HW the 2 cycles before this from Trebor, then Commander "The" Dr_Sci "Is In", and finally had been left ill prepared for the follow up onslaught by Trebor.  It would be fair to say that Platton was 'hydroplaned' over the last 3 cycles.  Well fought, well fought!     <br><br>

Elemental War Third Item: Bad Water, Bad!!   <br><br>
- If you were one of the few who missed the mano a mano fight several cycles ago at Badwater, you should find a moment to go back in your files and review it, as an example of epic struggle, a fight among matched equals, to the death.  (Editor's note: Or, you could look at it as 2 kindergarten kids fighting with crayons, in that it took for-freaking-ever.)  In the end, after THIRTY rounds of fighting, the invading Monk died of shame.         <br><br>
