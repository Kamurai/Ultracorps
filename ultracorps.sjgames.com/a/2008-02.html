<h2><a href="2008-02-27.html">February 27, 2008:</a> Ruh-Oh Games Starting</h2>
<p>The Ruh-oh ring games are now joinable, with 30 spaces in each. We ended up splitting them by XP instead of average.</p><ul>
<li> Ruh-oh 1 is exclusively for those with fewer than 50 XP.
<li> Ruh-oh 2 is open to everyone with fewer than 200 XP.
<li> Ruh-oh 3 is for players with 200 or more XP.
</ul>
<p>
Since the first three games filled so fast, we've created several more:</p>
<ul>
<li> Ruh-oh 4, for players with 50-200 XP.
<li> Ruh-oh 5 (formerly Ruh-oh 6), for players with any level of XP.
</ul>
<p>Go for it! Conquest is Job One!</p>

<h2><a href="2008-02-24.html">February 24, 2008:</a> Ruh-Oh Rings!</h2>
<p>We will soon launch three new ring games with the same setup. There will be one each for starting, medium, and high rated players.</p>

<p>Ruh-Oh will run for 25 daily turns.  The victory conditions will be classic (number of worlds controlled), and the economy will be on. Points credited will be standard for rings.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo fans will know what we mean by "Ruh-oh." Clearly, we over-buffed the Swampies and Entradishar, and we don't have to wait for Quince to finish in order to test the next round of changes:<ul>
<li> The Swampies lose their R-class, but they keep the license and the population advantage.
<li> The Giganto license and CPX both go to 750 for the Entradishar.
<li> The OMG is now a scanner with a range of 120.
<li> The poor unbuffed Ectonians get three extra cargo boosters, since we're not going to be testing any major buffs at the same time we debuff the currently strongest races.</ul></p>

<h2><a href="2008-02-09.html">February 9, 2008:</a> Quince Has Started</h2>
. . . and, though we announced it on the forum, we did not post news here. No excuse. We suspect the Sludge has infested our brains. The game is full; if you missed out, be sure to sign up on the <a href="https://secure.sjgames.com/login/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fultracorps.sjgames.com%2Fzgame%2Fgame%2Frequest_game.html">game request page</a>. If we get enough interest we'll start a ring game or something to give everyone their fix.

<h2><a href="2008-02-01.html">February 1, 2008:</a> Solo in 4!</h2>
<img src="../../secure.sjgames.com/login/indexfda0.html" alt="" align="left" hspace="8">
<p>
Congratulations to UC_Rommel for completing the first solo game in 4 turns! You can check out the game <a href="https://secure.sjgames.com/login/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fultracorps.sjgames.com%2Fzgame%2Fgame%2Fmain.html%3FgameID%3D41373">here.</a>

<h3>Lots of Updates</h3>
<p>
We've just rolled out a bunch of changes in preparation for the upcoming mega game (which we expect to open next week). Please read the <a href="http://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?p=527738#post527738">forum thread</a> for details. The racial help files have NOT been updated yet; we'll get to that shortly.</p>
<p>
We would like you to test the new changes. Any newly created game (solo or PUB) will get the new racial X-factors and bonuses, with the exception of Sxullborgs: all CURRENT games will get the Sxullborg perk, starting now.
</p>
<p>Note also that the LAST news item was so recent that you may not have seen it, so, to repeat: The "All Fleets" report has been modified to make it easier to notice when you have neglected to deploy a fleet. The undeployed fleet section of the report is now at the top . . . and if you have undeployed fleets, they show up with a red background.</p>
If you notice anything that doesn't look right - numbers don't add up, or you get a traceback or notice other bugs - please e-mail those to <a href="mailto:kira@sjgames.com">kira@sjgames.com</a>. We'll do our best to get any bugs worked out before we start the new mega.
</p>

<h2><a href="2008-02-01.html">February 1, 2008:</a> All Fleets Tweak / Sxull Perk</h2>
<p>The "All Fleets" report has been modified to make it easier to notice when you have neglected to deploy a fleet. The undeployed fleet section of the report is now at the top . . . and if you have undeployed fleets, they show up with a red background.</p>

<p>Also: one of the changes for the next game is a perk for the SxullBorgs. Because it's not part of setup, it will become active <i>for existing games</i> as soon as we migrate the code to the regular server. So if you're a Sxull in a PUB, and you notice something useful and odd . . . it's a feature, not a bug.</p>

<p>The full announcement of the next mega, and its changes, will be coming soon. All the changes will be implemented a few days before the new mega opens, to give everyone a chance to practice and to shake out the bugs.</p><br>-- Steve Jackson
