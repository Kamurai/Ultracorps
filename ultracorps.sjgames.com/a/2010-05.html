<h2><a href="2010-05-27.html">May 27, 2010:</a> Sort Of Fabulous Network News Update</h2>
Incinerator- Turn 13!  Spudfyre seizes the lead!<br><br>

Action Item: Of Homeworlds Lost... <br>
Multiple homeworlds fell this past tick, while others were successfully defended.  Consolations to those who've lost their HW and are now looking for a place to live, but congratulations to the victors like Commander Luckymonkey, who now, finally, can see beyond what is Known.<br><br>

Action Item: ...and of Homeworlds Saved!<br>
Gogmagog, a commander with apparent expectations of some apocalyptic war in the future (Editor's note: Er, now?), has come under fire from multiple enemies.  Commander Gog has resisted several HW attacks by different opponents over the past several turns, and gets a shout out for his defiance of both his enemies and the odds!  Give them the fang, Gog, but don't give them Fang!<br><br>

Action Item: Fluky Outcomes on "Unlucky" Turn 13!<br>
This author was apprised of 1 such fight, and was part of another.  Go check the battle at Sikin, where the suicidal Noz fighter piloted by "E Class" Jones took on a force of 195 fp and killed 2 HSF's before being slain!  Then, check out the battle at Rylgan, where a GPA fell apart after, perhaps, overhasty construction, against a vastly inferior foe on round 1 of combat.<br><br>

And now a word from our sponsor: Back to the Past Poker Emporium- "Try our ever popular Texas Held 'em!"<br>

<h2><a href="2010-05-24.html">May 24, 2010:</a> Congratulatory Ultramails!</h2>
Nothing says success like a congratulatory ultramail from The UC Admin.<br><br>

Some  might wonder what it takes to get one?<br>
A solo 10, 9, 8, 7 or 6 won't do it,  but a solo 5 or 4 will.<br><br>

Achieve a nice average, or certain MP level or hit a certain 100 level in XP and you can look for a mail.<br>

Mega winners not only get a congratulations in the forums, but also by ultramail and they also get to name their own world to become in some ways immortal.  Someday there may even be prizes!<br><br>

You never know, win the right battle and Travail or I might chime in.  Have fun and knock some heads.<br>

<h2><a href="2010-05-19.html">May 19, 2010:</a> Sort Of Fabulous Network News Update</h2>
Incinerator is underway!  There is some tight clustering on the leaderboard, fairly expected this early in the game.<br><br>

Action Item: Klingon and Romulan Hostilities at an End!<br>
The Romulan Empire erased doubts about their strategic and tactical ability by besting the Klingon Empire in a knock-down, drag-out-an-airlock battle.  Romulan Ale all around, and hold the Gakh... at least this time.<br><br>

Action Item: Hope For the Hopelessly Late!<br>
If you have missed entry into the Mega, fear not!  Either Administrator Starcharger or News Reporter Travail will be happy to open games for you- simply drop us a umail, ad we'll get on it.<br><br>

And now a word from our sponsor: Entradishar Empire Laundry Services- "Invade, rinse, repeat!"<br>Travail, UC News Reporter

Many of the Boutique Pubs will be finishing up just about the time Incinerator starts.<br><br>

The 1v1 League is getting a lot of play.  Go into the forums and look for the 1v1 Thread and toss your name in the hat if you would like to get involved.<br><br>

Have Fun!<br><br>
