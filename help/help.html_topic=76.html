 <h2>Customizing Units in a PUB Game</h2>
When you create a new PUB game, the unit stats will be set to the current system defaults, which you can see by creating a solo game. But you don’t have to accept the defaults. In your own PUB games, you can experiment with tweaking the unit stats . . . or changing them completely to design brand-new units.<P>
<B>Note that once we start charging for accounts, the ability to change unit stats in a PUB will become an Elite feature only.</B><P>
After you create your game, go to the PUB Admin page. One of the links near the top of the page, right under “View Game,” will be “Edit Game Units.”<P>
This link takes you to a spreadsheet which shows all units, in alphabetical order, and their stats. The only limitations on editing are some arbitrary high maximum values, and the rules of the game . . . you can’t assign a stat that will break the system. You may edit any unit stat <I>except</I>:<UL>
<LI> Unit name. Yes, it would be nice to allow names to be created or even added, but that feature does not exist yet.
<LI> OF, DF, AT, and PD for upgrade units and non-combat units . . . because they don’t have those stats.
<LI> Start price, license cost, and CPX for v2 and higher units . . . because they don’t have those stats.
<LI> You cannot give any unit a speed over 500.
<LI> You cannot give a unit any speed at all unless you make its CA zero or greater,
<LI> You cannot turn a non-combat unit (which is indestructible) into a combat unit, or vice versa. 
<LI> You cannot give any combat unit an OF of less than 1, or a DF or AT of more than 99.
<LI> Start price must be at least 5.
<LI> Don’t try to give anything except CA a negative value, or enter anything but a whole number!
<LI> No value can be over 10,000.</UL>
Note that you can also edit a couple of special unit attributes. If you enter a nonzero number into the Scanner Range field for any unit, that unit becomes a scanner with the specified range. (Known bug: Your custom Scanner Range settings will not properly interact with the warning icons on the “All Scanners” report, which is hardcoded to the default values.)<P>
And note the last field, Stealth. It is zero for all units except the Hurax; it is 1 for the Hurax. Any unit given a Stealth value of 1 becomes stealthed! For real fog of war, try an all-stealth game . . .<P>
You can only edit units BEFORE the game begins!<P>
