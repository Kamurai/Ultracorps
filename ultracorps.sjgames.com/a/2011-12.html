<h2><a href="2011-12-24.html">December 24, 2011:</a> SoFNN- Winter Rings Rock And Roll!</h2>
Winter Rings, Turn 6!     <br><br>

New game open for joins, for those of you who have missed the Winter Rings, or have enough time on your hands.  It's a 12 person ring game, more than half filled, so join up in Ring Around The Rosey right away!  <br><br>

Bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!  We would like to thank all the UC players in the Winter Rings, who are all as individual as snowflakes....with Zenrin masters riding on them.             <br><br>

Action Item- Winter Ring 1: Mighty Mapmaker Mooches Tango and Cash!       <br>
- Commander "I pick things up and make maps" Thrognor found the last Tango in the Paris Nebula this past cycle, capturing Tango and its ultranium store with a single, well-foddered N-class battleship.  An unidentified source reports that, upon hearing word of the victory, a pleased Commander Thrognor said "Hah, and they said it takes 2 to Tango"!     <br><br>

Action Item- Winter Ring 2: Jodos Seeks Goal, Reaches Farthest Star!           <br>
- This past cycle, the watching masses yelled "GOAL!" when Commander Jodos took the shot that scored at the planet Goal, securing the world in a handy win which spared both of his E-class suicide haulers.  In a statement to SoFNN reporters, Jodos said: "Hey, Goals are just dreams with deadlines."   <br><br>

SoFNN would like to call your attention to a timeless favorite, as we wish everyone a fantastic holiday season, and happy and healthy New Year:  http://ultracorps.sjgames.com/zgame/forums/?id=2&topic=90&msg=11#11 <br><br>

And now, a word from our sponsor: Alice's Winter Ring Tours, Inc- "Come join me for a nice walking around in a Winter Ring Wonderland!"<br><br>Travail, UC News Reporter

<h2><a href="2011-12-13.html">December 13, 2011:</a> Holiday Rings Ready To Rock!</h2>
<p>
Two new Holiday Ring games are now formed, and will use classic scoring (most worlds wins). The maps were built at 8pm Saturday, and the first tick will be Monday Dec. 19th at 8pm CST.  Expect maps through the games, as Mapmaker Thrognor has promised his usual indispensable star charts to plan by!
</p>

<p>
Tick times will be 8pm CST, with no ticks on Christmas Day (Dec 25) or New Year's Eve (Dec 31).
</p>

<p>
Note: You must complete a solo game before you can enter one of the ring games.
</p>

Lastly, a new large PUB with unit modifications allowing all fighters some carry, and the smallest ground units are stealthed, allowing them to ride in a fighter to your target!  Umail Ultimatequestion for the password to join Spacecrew Delight- there are still spots open to join, especially if you missed the Winter Rings!<br><br>
