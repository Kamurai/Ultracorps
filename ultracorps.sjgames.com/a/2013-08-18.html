<h2><a href="2013-08-18.html">August 18, 2013:</a> SoFNN- On The Grid, Turn 26</h2>
News, news, news, from the Sort of Fantastic Network News!!     <br><br>

With all the news that's fit to embellish, think of us as your exclusive source of antiquated Terran German second person, transitive verbs: we are bringing you the best of the best and the worst of the wirst, since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!   <br><br>

The Grid Action Item: Two Chicks At The Same Time?  Hah!!    <br><br>
-  Forget everything you knew about what was possible, and feast your eyes, ears, sensory tentacles, and other applicable sensory organs on the SIMULTANEOUS capture of two homeworlds by Not-So-Anonymous Guderian back on cycle 19!  To this reporter's recollection, such a feat has not been accomplished before.  Like, ever.  Talk about bringing the boom!  Though DarFenPrime and DingDongDell were both liberated by their respective commanders, the achievement is certainly worthy of a headline. (Editor's note: Even if it's several turns late!)       <br><br>

The Grid Second Item:  Where Hopes And Dreams And Dead Fish Go!!    <br><br>
-  Commander Replay showed a 'royal flush' this past cycle, defending his hw of Toilet from Darth Vain.  The failure of the attack by Darth Vain's forces was 'most disappointing to the Emperor'.  In a statement to the press from his personal NClass V3, he has sworn the defeat of Replay, by "this fully ARMED and OPERATIONAL battle station!"  In a related statement to SoFNN, Replay has suggested to this Emperor to "sith on it!"     <br><br>

The Grid Third Item:  It's Good For The Digestive System For Some Races!!  <br><br>
-   In search of both extra worlds and fiber, Commander Teddywolf invaded Grotbran this past cycle.  The able defense of the planet was handled by Lunches-on-Lorax, who, not surprisingly, likes his Grotbran.  A lot, apparently.  With 2 scoops of boron.  Buggies.  <br><br>

And now, a word from our sponsor: United Gone-Postal Service- "Neither meteor rain, nor methane snow, nor cosmic rays in the gloom of space, will stay these local couriers from taking your homeworld."  <br><br>Travail, UC News Reporter
