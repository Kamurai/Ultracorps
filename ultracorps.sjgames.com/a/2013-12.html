<h2><a href="2013-12-25.html">December 25, 2013:</a> SoFNN: Ring-Ring-Ring!  Winter Rings Underway-Ish!</h2>
News, news, news, from the Sort of Fantastic Network News!!     <br><br>

With all the news that's fit to embellish!  Who will be the Lords of the Rings, and who will be just another bunch of filthy hobbitses?  Time will tell- on to the news!   <br><br>

Winter Ring 1, Action Item: "I'll Have A Guiness!!"    <br><br>
-  So said ScaryRaven, but Zen had an answer: "Oh no you won't!"  Zen led his forces in an effective defense of his homeworld, and denied a thirsty man a drink.  We at SoFNN understand, of course, the need for both a stiff defense, and a stiff drink.     <br><br>

Winter Ring 2, Action Item: Quesotrain Gets An Offer, Goes For Retirement!!     <br><br>
-  We certainly hope he reached it with pre-tax Ultranium!  One could say, based on the quick battle, that Quesotrain took an early Retirement. We wouldn't, of course, but someone could.    <br><br>

Winter Ring 3, Inaction Item: Zippity Goes Looking For The Doodah!!  <br><br>
-  ... And finds it after drinking the milk of his most recent conquest, Magnesia.  Expectations are high for a flow of impending movements.  Er, fleet movements, that is.  <br><br>

And now, a word from our sponsor: The Optimistic Wheat Thins Society- "Pollyanna wanna cracker."  <br>

<h2><a href="2013-12-15.html">December 15, 2013:</a> SoFNN: Ring-Ring-Ring!  Winter Rings Underway-Ish!</h2>
News, news, news, from the Sort of Fantastic Network News!!     <br><br>

With all the news that's fit to embellish, we are back in publication! Now that the recent Zombie outbreak is over, the universe has reorganized itself to, shall we say, "Winter Ring in the New Year".  Winter Rings 1 and 2 are underway, and number 3 is, like our patented dark chocolate truffles, filling.  Who will be the Lords of the Rings, and who will be just another bunch of filthy hobbitses?  Time will tell- on to the news!   <br><br>

Winter Ring 1, Action Item: Mission Definitely Possible!!    <br><br>
-  El Gato Loco invaded Mission like a man... er... like a Spider on a... er... Mission.  After annihilating the defense of the planet (along with about 60% of the population), El Gato explained the... er... Missionary position to the survivors as he took charge of the planet.     <br><br>

Winter Ring 2, Action Item: Joanie No Longer Loves A Chachi!!     <br><br>
-  At least not after Habig invaded Achachi this past cycle, tearing through the defenders easily and taking control of the world without losing a tin-foil psi hauler in the process.  Jimmy Durante offered this observation: "A cha cha cha... chi!"     <br><br>

Winter Ring 3, Inaction Item: Not Much Going On, But There's Twelve People Being Bored To Tears!!  <br><br>
-  'Nuff said.  Join up if you're not already wearing a Winter Ring!  <br><br>

And now, a word from our sponsor: Society of Insecure Demons with Hair Loss- "Something evil this way combs-over!" <br>
