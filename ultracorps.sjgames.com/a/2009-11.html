<h2><a href="2009-11-30.html">November 30, 2009:</a> Omega Is Open For Joining</h2>
<p>
Our final beta-test mega game <b><a href="https://secure.sjgames.com/login/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fultracorps.sjgames.com%2Fzgame%2Fgame%2Fgameinfo.html%3FgameID%3D63510">Omega</a></b> is now open for joining. The map will be built AFTER joining has closed, which will be 7pm CST on Wednesday. If you want to play, please join before then!
</p>

<p>
All players will receive UltraMail when the map is built, so you can log in and do your starting turn.
</p>

<p>
The first tick will be on Thursday December 3rd.
</p>

<p>
Have fun, & thanks to everyone for helping us test <b><i>UltraCorps</i></b> these last few years. We're looking forward to launching the game!

<h2><a href="2009-11-23.html">November 23, 2009:</a> Email Preferences, And The Next Mega</h2>
<p>
You'll notice a new link on your profile page to "Edit Prefs"; right now this manages your preferences for receiving e-mail from <b><i>UltraCorps</i></b>. If you'd like to be notified whenever there's a new mega game open, you can set that in your prefs.
</p>

<p>
We've also added a preference for e-mail notifications whenever a PUB or Mega game you're in has ticked. This setting can be changed on a per-game basis from your Empire page; we've also added a new radio button to the "join game" page asking if you'd like to receive tick notifications. The default will be whatever you have set on your prefs page.
</p>

<p>
And to avoid spam, if you'd rather not receive any e-mail from <b><i>UltraCorps</i></b> ever, you can set your no-mail preference to YES. 
</p>

<h3>The Next Mega</h3>

<p>
...will open for joining on Monday Nov. 30th. If you'd like to suggest a name for it, visit the <a href="../zgame/forums/index0b30.html?id=2">forums</a>. We think this will be the last free mega game; <b><i>UltraCorps</i></b> will finally launch at the beginning of next year.
</p>

<h3>Now Accepting Admin Applications</h3>

<p>
We're looking to hire an admin for <b><i>UltraCorps</i></b>. You can read the details <a href="../zgame/forums/indexf90a.html?id=2&amp;topic=201&amp;msg=44#44">here</a>.

<h2><a href="2009-11-09.html">November 9, 2009:</a> Super PUBs!</h2>
<p>
We've rolled out some changes to PUB games. When you create a new PUB game, you can now view the game map without joining. Also, the PUB admin index page is now a list of your currently hosted PUB games (for most people that'll just be one game).
</p>
<p>
The "edit game units" feature has been removed from beta testing; that'll be an Elite feature on launch, and has been moved to Elite-only access now for final testing.
</p>
<p>
As a player, you may notice some super-sized PUB games on the <a href="https://secure.sjgames.com/login/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fultracorps.sjgames.com%2Fzgame%2Fgame%2Fpub.html">PUB page</a>; feel free to join and help us test these super-sized PUBs!
