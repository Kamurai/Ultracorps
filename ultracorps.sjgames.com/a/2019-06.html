<h2><a href="2019-06-20.html">June 20, 2019:</a> News Addicts' Mega News</h2>
<p>Mega News-- Feeding Frenzy, Turn 32!</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> When The Moon Hits Your Eye Like A Big Harvest Pie, That's Farstar!</p> 
<p>- Commander Farstar crushed the defenses at Harvestmoon this past cycle, making sure the hapless natives got their recommended daily dose of Xiron.  </p>
<p></p>
<p> Yaddra Yadda Yadda!</p> 
<p>- The galaxy seems much smaller these days, especially as commanders vie for worlds before the Feeding Frenzy ends.  Collisions and collusions abound, including what looks to be one at Yaddra, as the Placidest of Platypi crashed some ships into Ubones' assembled mighty fist.  More seem likely.  Placid Platypus told our reporter: "Welp.  The future sure ain't what it used to be." </p> 
<p></p>
<p> Well, That Was Cracky! </p> 
<p>- An infinita went to Kraki this past tick, and fought an uphill battle against a small outpost of Starcharger's.  It fought alone on the last two rounds of combat, and has been dubbed "The Fodder That Would Not Die."    </p> 
<p></p>

<p>Mega News-- Feeding Frenzy, Turn 11!</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> Nobody Node Nothing!</p> 
<p>- Placid Platypus flashed into Node with contrails blazing, dropping a whole mess of capable ground units to seize control of the planet!  </p>
<p></p>
<p> Ariasa Erased!</p> 
<p>- The defenses of Ariasa were swept away by the forces of Narcy7, mostly having been devoured by the copious scuttlers packed into the invasion fleet. The planet's effectively supported X fighters were no match for the determined commander. </p> 
<p></p>
<p> Wardmeister Taught Just Who Is Meister! </p> 
<p>- The excessively experienced Habig took his TAPS into Wardmeister, subjugating his natural inclination to abduct the populace in favor of simply 'abducting' control of the world.    </p>

<p>Mega News-- Turn 5!</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> Hipso, Facto!</p> 
<p>- Placid Platypus demolished the population at Hipso during his victorious invasion, letting his ATR's run roughshod over everything, and everyone, in sight!  </p>
<p></p>
<p> Caruso Likes 'Em Rondanwet!</p> 
<p>- Commander Caruso took the fight to Rondanwet this past tick, capturing the planet in a swift victory which, nevertheless, left some troops stranded. </p>

<p>Mega News-- Turn 2!</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> Liliput In Its Tiny, Little Place!</p> 
<p>- Ubones unleashed his force on Li-li-fu, showing them a little of that ole Zenrin-fu.  The natives turned over control to their new overlord happily when he spared all of the civilian population!  </p>
<p></p>
<p> Zada Offers More Than Nada!</p> 
<p>- The defenses of Zada gave a rather rough welcome to the liberating forces of Commander Koneko this past tick.  Telekinetically-powered tanks and a bike carried the battle, though with moderate losses.  (Editor's note: Too bad they weren't Precog tanks and bikes.) </p> 
<p></p>
<p> For The Night Is Dark And Full Of Shade! </p> 
<p>- Nozamamaster Malagster sent his forces into Nightshade, scoring a resounding victory against the indigenous troops.  Early reports suggest the coopted military apparatus is getting set to crank out nozama fighters to propel further expansion.   </p>
