<h2><a href="2010-06-06.html">June 6, 2010:</a> Sort Of Fabulous Network News Update- June 6</h2>
Incinerator: Turn 23!<br><br>

Action Item: How Many Licks Does It Take To Get To The Center Of A Galaxy?<br>
- Commander Licker has seized the lead over the past several turns, and yet there is still a relatively tight cluster atop the world leaderboard.  Will opportunists arise to take advantage?  Will other commanders surge to the lead with daring defensive displays or dazzling diplomacy?  These questions and alluring alliterations will be answered.... over the next 12 to 14 turns! <br><br>

Second Item: Feeding Frenzy Over As Final Battle, Universe Ends!<br>
- As they say in the Norse mythology of Old Terra, "Ragnor Rocks" signals the end of all, and so Ragnor won the contest in the PUB "Young Sharks".  Congratulations to all the players, and especially to Commander Ragnor, for what looked like a great game.  Well done all!.<br><br>

Third Item: Random Chance Has Acted in Ultimate Question's Favor!<br>
- UQ has triumphed in Random Race Challenge 2, taking his Orn fleets to victory over his foes.  To win, he had to subOrn his enemies, be a thOrn in their sides, and remain Ornery to the end.  Despite the horrible odds and puns ranged against him, arithmetic on the 61 worlds he controls is now being done in base 13, so that 6x9 actually does equal 42.  Congratulations UQ!<br><br>

Final Item: New PUB Opens For New Players!<br>
- For players with less than 150 xp, try out the new game just opened up.  The first tick is planned for June 8 at 8 pm (CST), but will be pushed back if the game hasn't filled.<br><br>

And now a word from our sponsors: Light Speed News- "All the news that's fit to sprint!<br><br><br>Travail, UC News Reporter
