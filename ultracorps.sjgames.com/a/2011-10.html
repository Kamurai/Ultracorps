Kira is taking back her role as Admin of Ultracorps.  It should be fun to watch as her involvement increases.<br>I have certainly enjoyed my time serving the community and plan to stay active as a player.<br><br>

The second points game is designed to see how players perform in a points game now that most of us understand how it actually works.<br>  Are there going to be any changes in the leaderboard?<br>Is Travail going to win for a fourth time?<br><br><br>-- Starcharger

<h2><a href="2011-10-09.html">October 9, 2011:</a> SoFNN- Logjam Update</h2>
Logjam Mega, Turn 27!     <br><br>

Bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!             <br><br>

Action Item: Monsters Are Such Innnnnnteresting People!             <br>
- Or at least one would guess such by the fate of their home planet, Monsterpocalypse, which changed hands again this past cycle.  Originally captured from Commander Hair10 by an old gringo (Editor's note: Actually, Commander Old Gringo), the planet once again has passed into new hands- those of Commander Rand.  A spokesperson for the indigenous population told us in a statement: "Meh, it's confusing, but it's good for tourism."      <br><br>

Second Item: Newlyweds On Shim-Goleth Say: "It's Got To Be The Bot, Bob!!"    <br><br>
- Shim-Goleth bore witness to an all megabot battle between Ectonian Commanders Goimon and Fraien08 this past cycle.  V3's and V'4s filled the sky over Shim this past cycle, as the native population got a live-and-in-your-face demonstration of mecha-anime at its finest, as Fraien08 gave Goimon's attack fleet the megaBOOT.              <br><br>

Third Item: Finding The Calm In The Storm!    <br><br>
- In one of the largest fp-destroyed battles of the cycle, Commander Maturin mounted a strong defense against the attacking Commander Habig at the planet Storm.  Maturin gave a statement to reporters, saying: "The wise man in a storm prays, not for safety from danger, but deliverance from fear."  When this reporter confronted him about having stolen this quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson, Maturin responded: "Oh yeah? Well, if he doesn't like it, let him bring an attack fleet and tell me his-damn-self!"    <br><br>


And now, a word from our sponsor: The First Church of Holy Mathematics- "Please feel free to join us for worship- it's okay if you're pi-curious."       <br>   <br>Travail, UC News Reporter

<h2><a href="2011-10-02.html">October 2, 2011:</a> SoFNN...Logjam, The Points Mega</h2>
Logjam Mega, Turn 20!     <br><br>

We're back!  Bringing you the best of the best since we started feeling like it and you started paying attention!             <br><br>

Action Item: So, Ha Big Was It??             <br>
- The recent capture of N0b0dy from Brendanjlane by commander Habig this past cycle marks one of the latest two hw's to fall in Logjam.  The other capture, Nozing To See Here, was managed by Temporal Captain Loras, who wrested the planet from notable extremist, X_streamist.  Sergeant Schultz, of old Terra "Hogan's Heroes" fame, bore witness to both attacks but claims: "I saw N0b0dy and dere was Nozing To See Here, Colonel Klink!"      <br><br>

Second Item: Move Over Methusaleh, Rex Does Requiem For Caesar!          <br><br>
-  Rexmf handled an able defense against attacker UC_Caesar this past cycle at the planet Requiem.  The Sxullborg commander really 'cashed in' on the win, repleting his coffers at the expense of the invader.  Said Rex: "I came to recycle Caesar, not to praise him." Talk about the Rx for what ails you!            <br><br>

Third Item: If a Treedonia Doesn't Fall In A Forest, Does Anyone Hear it?       <br><br>
- Well, it was more than just a shot heard around the world, but the invasion of Treedonia by Admiral "AJ" Joey was brought to a screeching halt by the orbiting moon guns of Commander Old "Y but Goody" Cat this past cycle.  This is the 3rd major attack of AJ's which Oldcat has repelled in recent cycles, with his OMGs giving such a good account of themselves that all umails leaving the planet now start with "OMG, did you see the fireworks with that last attack?"       <br><br>


And now, a word from our sponsor: The Committee for the Responsible Use of Y in Advertising- "When what you're looking for is a good workout, make sure you don't go to Fit Bod Booty Camp!"               <br><br>Travail, UC News Reporter
