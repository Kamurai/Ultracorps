<h2><b><i>UltraCorps</i></b> Change Log for 2009</h2>
<h2>December 29, 2009</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Revised the standings page; to be listed in the "Average Rating" column,
        players must have completed at least 2 mega games, and the most recent
        mega must have been within the last 3 months.</li>
</ul>
<h2>December 27, 2009</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Awarded Beta badges to all players who played in a mega or ring game after
        Last. (Not including quitters, or players who didn't play past turn 10.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>December 25-26, 2009</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Router outage (failed port on the switch) had UC offline from around 6pm
        on the 25th to 7:30pm on the 26th. The Omega tick ran on the 25th; was
        suspended on the 26th.</li>
</ul>
<h2>December 22, 2009</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed assemble-fleet code to require fleet names to be alphanumeric.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Production orders can now be un-canceled. Helpfile updated.</li>
</ul>
<h2>December 14, 2009</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Admins can now chown PUB games to new owners, if necessary.</li>
    <li>Homeworlds may not be named after other players. Also, homeworld names

</ul>
<h2>November 30, 2009</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The last free mega game
        <b>Omega</b>opened for joins.</li>
    <li>Found and slew bug affecting 2-player PUBs with large clusters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>November 27, 2009</h2>
<ul>
    <li>PUB games that don't tick for 21 days are auto-deleted. PUB game owners
        will now receive UltraMail and e-mail notifying them that their game is
        coming up on deletion. This is sent 7 days before deletion, and 24 hours

</ul>
<h2>November 23, 2009</h2>

        dispatching e-mail notifications of new mega games as well as game-has-ticked
        notifications.</li>
    <li>Added a pref for receiving PUB invites by e-mail. Fixed the PUB game invite
        script to use the new notification/email/prefs system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>November 17, 2009</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lots and lots of little help file updates over the past couple of days,
        and one intance of "Whoops, the help file says we're going to add this,
        and it never made it to the actual to-do list, but we want it!" Also updated
        the online List and Anti-List. The pre-launch list is getting steadily
        shorter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>November 15, 2009</h2>
<ul>

    <li>Race tweaks: Arachnons receive decaying Scuttler spawn for several ticks
        after a world is captured. (SJ note: Euw! "Decaying Scuttler spawn"! What
        this means is that Scuttlers continue to appear, but only half as many,
